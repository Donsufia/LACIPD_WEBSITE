                <h1>UST HAVE A DREAM; WORK TOWARDS IT AND THE LORD WILL ACTUALIZE IT.</h1>
                <h2>THE BEGINNINGS </h2>
                <p>It was in the year 2010 as I was preaching with the Church of Christ, Ediene Ikot Obio Imo, Uyo, <br>Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, West Africa; studying the English language with the University of Uyo and<br> lecturing the Bible at the School of Preaching, Nigerian Christian Institute, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, West Africa;<br> that I dreamt of teaching people, privately, who need the basic English language skills to function well in the<br> society while doing better in their professions. This thought came to me as an affirmation of the saying, <br>that: Necessity is the mother of invention. It was difficult for me to take care of my young and struggling family, then.<br> So, I thought that if I could use the available (my basic knowledge of the English language) that I could own the<br> desirable (money to sponsor myself in the University and take care of my family). This formed the foundation of <br>nursing how to teach the public the English language. I started that immediately by advertising and announcing to people<br> that dream. Luckily, I had one person who came for the private tutorial and I started with that <br>person. The second person was trained to write the General Certificate Examination (GCE) which she succeeded in <br>the examination with C6 in English after a three week intensive drill.  In two years, I had not less than ten different private learners. <br>That immediately informed me of an English language Academy which materialized in January 2017<br> after a careful assessment, consideration and plan with my dear late heart throb, Mrs. Mercy William, <br>whose soul I shall continue to pray to rest in peace till we meet again, to part no more
